Project Overview

A digital invitation card generator that creates:

 - Wedding cards

 - Birthday cards

 - Engagement cards

 - Baby shower cards

 - Anniversary invitations

Instead of printing physical cards, users upload a couple passport-size photo, and the system automatically converts it into a traditional Indian-style wedding portrait using AI.
Then it places this portrait into a wedding card template and allows easy sharing through WhatsApp, Telegram, Email, or API.

System auto-generates a digital card containing:

 - Couple AI portrait

 - Wedding title

 - Date & Time

 - Venue details

 - Reception info

 - RSVP

 - Google Map link
